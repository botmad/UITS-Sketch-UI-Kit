# UITS Sketch UI Kit

<!-- [Download](https://github.com/botmad/UITS-Sketch-UI-Kit/releases/latest/download/UITS.sketch) -->

The idea behind creating this resource was to make a UI kit that makes it easier to match its look and feel with any UI framework. In most UI kits out there, only replacing colours and fonts can be done effortlessly, while style/branding subtleties remain distributed across multiple pages and components. This kit aims to reduce the amount of restyling work needed to meet target branding by embedding instances of a few reusable surfaces within the multitude of symbols.

<sup>Restyle the entire kit from within the single styling panel. There's no need to go through the uncountable symbols.</sup><br/><br/>

Since Sketch introduced the [Smart Layout](https://www.sketch.com/features/smart-layout), [Color Variables](https://www.sketch.com/docs/designing/styling/color-variables/), [Overrides](https://www.sketch.com/docs/designing/symbols/editing-symbols/#how-to-edit-instances-with-overrides) etc., creating components and maintaining all their factors can be very time-consuming and distract you from your actual purpose - designing a good user experience. This UI kit aims to take some of the maintenance pain away by providing you with a range of symbols that take advantage of all of the aforementioned features.

UI kit's structure and naming convention follow the Universal Interface Theming Standard (UITS).

### AG-Grid template included

The UI kit comes with a template for creating the [AG-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) tables. Supported AG-Grid themes:
- Alpine
- Balham
- ~~Custom theme derived from the UITS configuration, inheriting the UI kit branding.~~ coming soon.

## Why using this kit

|  |  |  
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <img src="https://palmaka.design/sketch-uits-db/well-structured@2x.jpg" width="3000" alt="screenshot"/>      | __Well structured boiler-plate suitable for web and cross-platform designs__ <br> Particularly useful as a Sketch Library to serve as a shared fundament in collaborative projects.       |
| <img src="https://palmaka.design/sketch-uits-db/fully-theme-able@2x.jpg" width="3000" alt="screenshot"/>   | __Fully theme-able.__ <br> Restyling the entire design system can be done without having to tweak every component included in the package. The UI kit has a _Styling_ page that serves as a "branding control panel", allowing modification of the look and feel in a single space.      |
| <img src="https://palmaka.design/sketch-uits-db/design-variables@2x.jpg" width="3000" alt="screenshot"/>   | __Design variables set that is transmittable to development__ <br> Having a variable-driven design system preset in Sketch saves time while enforcing the consistency and discipline of reusability. By utilising UITS, developers may use a textual set of properties to style their front-end instead of recreating it from mockups. Global style changes are easy to introduce within an existing system if it's just a matter of tweaking a variable.        |
| <img src="https://palmaka.design/sketch-uits-db/dev-style-guides@2x.jpg" width="3000" alt="screenshot"/>   | __Developer style guides provided upfront__ <br> While design delivery tools like Zeplin are great enhancers of the precision of implementation, providing the style guide at the right time additionally increases the chance that the structure and naming convention remain synchronised between the design and development.         |
| <img src="https://palmaka.design/sketch-uits-db/states@2x.jpg" width="3000" alt="screenshot"/>   | __States for every interactive component__ <br> The style guide includes component states (disabled, hover, focused, active) to ensure correct implementation and accurate prototyping        |
| <img src="https://palmaka.design/sketch-uits-db/smart-layout@2x.jpg" width="3000" alt="screenshot"/>   | __Smart Layout variations__ <br> Many UI elements include [Smart Layout](https://www.sketch.com/features/smart-layout) variations, allowing the creation of symbols that auto-align based on their override fields configuration.        |
| <img src="https://palmaka.design/sketch-uits-db/alt-sizes@2x.jpg" width="3000" alt="screenshot"/>   | __Alternative size variations__ <br> Base components come in multiple size variations, allowing the design system to cater for different cases. E.g. for desktop and mobile media queries within the same project, or to govern the UI framework for a data-dense app along with a separate brochure website promoting it.        |
| <img src="https://palmaka.design/sketch-uits-db/dark-mode@2x.jpg" width="3000" alt="screenshot"/>   | __Dark mode variations__ <br> The dark mode concept is transitioning from being a desired to the mandatory feature - especially on mobile.       |
