# UITS Sketch UI Kit

>Since Sketch introduced the Smart Layout, Color Variables, Overrides etc., creating components and maintaining all these factors can be very time-consuming and distract you from your actual purpose - designing a good user experience. This UI kit aims to take some of the maintenance pain away. It's a starter template intended to make restyling of its entire design system easier, so you can match it with the target branding upfront before assembling your UI. 
>
>UI kit's structure and naming convention follow the Universal Interface Theming Standard (UITS).

__AG-Grid template included__

The UI kit comes with a template for creating the [AG-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) tables. Supported AG-Grid themes:
- Alpine
- Balham
+ Theme derived from the UITS settings that inherit the UI kit branding.

_If you're looking for just the AG-Grid Sketch template, you can grab it from [here](#)_
