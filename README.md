# UITS Sketch UI Kit

<!-- [Download](https://github.com/botmad/UITS-Sketch-UI-Kit/releases/latest/download/UITS.sketch) -->

The idea behind creating this resource was to make a UI kit that makes it easier to match its look and feel with any UI framework. In most UI kits out there, only replacing colours and fonts can be done effortlessly, while style/branding subtleties remain distributed across multiple pages and components. This kit aims to reduce the amount of restyling work needed to meet target branding by embedding instances of a few reusable surfaces within the multitude of symbols.

<sup>Restyle the entire kit from within the single styling panel. There's no need to go through the uncountable symbols.</sup><br/><br/>

Since Sketch introduced the [Smart Layout](https://www.sketch.com/features/smart-layout), [Color Variables](https://www.sketch.com/docs/designing/styling/color-variables/), [Overrides](https://www.sketch.com/docs/designing/symbols/editing-symbols/#how-to-edit-instances-with-overrides) etc., creating components and maintaining all their factors can be very time-consuming and distract you from your actual purpose - designing a good user experience. This UI kit aims to take some of the maintenance pain away by providing you with a range of symbols that take advantage of all of the aforementioned features.

<sup>Symbols come in multiple variations, sizes and Smart Layout configurations.</sup><br/><br/>

UI kit's structure and naming convention follow the Universal Interface Theming Standard (UITS).

__AG-Grid template included__

The UI kit comes with a template for creating the [AG-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) tables. Supported AG-Grid themes:
- Alpine
- Balham
- ~~Custom theme derived from the UITS configuration, inheriting the UI kit branding.~~ coming soon.

> _If you're looking for just the AG-Grid Sketch template only, you can grab it from [here](https://github.com/botmad/AG-Grid-Sketch-Kit)_

## Why using this kit
- __Well structured boiler-plate suitable for web and cross-platform designs__  
Particularly useful as a Sketch Library to serve as a shared fundament in collaborative projects.

- __Fully theme-able.__  
Restyling the entire design system can be done without having to tweak every component included in the package. The UI kit has a _Styling_ page that serves as a "branding control panel", allowing modification of the look and feel in a single space.

- __Design variables set that is transmittable to development__  
Having a variable-driven design system preset in Sketch saves time while enforcing the consistency and discipline of reusability. By utilising UITS, developers may use a textual set of properties to style their front-end instead of recreating it from mockups. Global style changes are easy to introduce within an existing system if it's just a matter of tweaking a variable.

- __Developer style guides provided upfront__  
While design delivery tools like Zeplin are great enhancers of the precision of implementation, providing the style guide at the right time additionally increases the chance that the structure and naming convention remain synchronised between the design and development. 

- __States for every interactive component__  
The style guide includes component states (disabled, hover, focused, active) to ensure correct implementation and accurate prototyping

- __Smart Layout variations__  
Many UI elements include Smart Layout variations, allowing the creation of symbols that auto-align based on their override fields configuration.

- __Alternative size variations__  
Base components come in multiple size variations, allowing the design system to cater for different cases. E.g. for desktop and mobile media queries within the same project, or to govern the UI framework for a data-dense app along with a separate brochure website promoting it.

## Quick Start

### Changing the branding

<!-- ### Using the kit

1. Providing the developer style guide upfront
2. Difference between the dark mode and over dark variations.
3. Using base surfaces
4. Using UI surface variations to reflect UI element state -->
